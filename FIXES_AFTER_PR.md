# Fixes Applied After PR #16

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. Configuration Parameter Passing (Commit: 69175d3)
**Issue**: cv_folds and other config parameters weren't being passed from config.yml to the SOM analyzer
**Fix**: Updated `_get_analysis_parameters` in run_analysis.py to include:
- `cv_folds` parameter (future runs will use 3 instead of default 5)
- `observed_columns` and `predicted_columns`
- `save_results` and `output_dir`

### 2. Monitoring Tools (Commit: bc4367a)
**Added**: Created monitoring tools for long-running analyses:
- `monitor_som_live.py` - Real-time progress monitoring script
- `som_run_status.md` - Detailed status documentation

## Current Production Run Status
- Started: 10:11 AM
- Grid Size: 15Ã—15 (correctly using configured size)
- Dataset: 11.3M samples, 94.8% missing data
- CV Folds: 5 (fix will apply to future runs)
- Status: Running CV fold 1/5, actively computing
- Estimated completion: 4-5 hours (within 5-hour deadline)

## Performance Observations
- High memory usage (776GB/1TB) with swap usage
- Partial Bray-Curtis distance calculations are computationally intensive with 94.8% missing data
- Process running at 102% CPU, making steady progress

## Next Steps
1. Let current run complete (4-5 hours remaining)
2. Future runs will benefit from cv_folds=3 optimization
3. Consider further optimizations for high missing data scenarios

All critical bugs have been fixed and the analysis is proceeding correctly.
