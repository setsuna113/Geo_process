# Unified Resampling Pipeline Status

## âœ… COMPLETED CORE INTEGRATION
- **Fundamental resampling integration is complete and functional**
- Individual dataset resampling working perfectly:
  - plants-richness: Shape (9, 9), Resolution 0.2Â°
  - terrestrial-richness: Shape (9, 9), Resolution 0.2Â°
- Fixed critical bugs:
  1. Negative dimensions bug (bounds order in catalog)  
  2. Database insertion bug (metadata JSON serialization)
- Architecture integration successful (config, database, processors)

## ðŸ”§ CURRENT PROGRESS - MERGER FIX
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Identified and started fixing merger issue

**Problem Identified**: Pipeline calls `raster_merger.merge_custom_rasters()` which looks for original rasters in catalog, but needs to use resampled dataset data from database.

**Solution Started**: 
- Modified `_run_merging_phase()` to call `_merge_resampled_datasets()` instead of RasterMerger
- Partially implemented direct merge from database approach
- File: `src/pipelines/unified_resampling/pipeline_orchestrator.py` line 186

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete implementation of `_merge_resampled_datasets()` method
2. Add database query to load resampled data 
3. Create xarray dataset from multiple resampled arrays
4. Run full pipeline test: resample â†’ merge â†’ SOM analysis

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pipelines/unified_resampling/pipeline_orchestrator.py` (merger approach changed)
- `PIPELINE_STATUS.md` (this status file)

## ðŸŽ¯ FINAL GOAL
Complete full end-to-end pipeline test with real small dataset subset
