Geo Project - Comprehensive Fix Implementation Plan
Root Issues Identified
1. ‚úÖ Critical 7-Hour Hang Issue (RESOLVED)
Location: src/raster_data/loaders/metadata_extractor.py:20 - gdal.Open() call
Cause: GDAL synchronously loading massive raster files (GB+ size) with no timeout/progress
Impact: Process hangs before any database records are created
Evidence: Database shows 1 raster_source with pending status, no cache/grid/feature data
‚úÖ FIXED: Lightweight metadata extraction with GDAL timeout protection implemented
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Pressure During Data Resampling (NEW CRITICAL ISSUE)
Location: src/processors/data_preparation/resampling_processor.py - _load_raster_data_with_timeout() and resampling engines
Cause: Loading entire large raster files (100+ MB) into memory without chunking
Impact: Pipeline hangs with critical memory pressure, no progress updates
Evidence: Pipeline starts successfully, registers metadata, but hangs during actual data processing
Symptoms: 100% CPU usage, continuous memory pressure warnings, process becomes unresponsive
3. Missing Progress Monitoring System
Current: Only high-level workflow progress in resampling_workflow.py
Missing: File I/O, tile-level, engine-level progress tracking
Gap: Progress reports exist but never update during actual processing
Impact: Cannot monitor resampling progress or identify bottlenecks
4. Incomplete Checkpointing System
Exists: BaseTileProcessor has tile-level checkpointing
Missing: No checkpointing in main pipeline stages (raster loading, resampling, merging)
Issue: Database experiments track only high-level state, not processing steps
5. Poor Process Management
Current: Basic bash ‚Üí Python ‚Üí tmux chain
Problem: No pause/resume, no graceful shutdown, no signal handling
Missing: Process lifecycle management, state persistence
