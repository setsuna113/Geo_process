  . Fix Checkpoint Directory Issue

  - Rename checkpoint output directory to checkpoint_data/ or checkpoint_outputs/

  2. Implement Centralized Logging System

  - Create src/infrastructure/logging/ module with:
    - Structured logging with JSON output
    - Log rotation and retention policies
    - Context-aware logging (experiment ID, stage, etc.)
    - Separate log streams for debugging, monitoring, and audit

  3. Enhanced Monitoring System

  - Real-time pipeline progress tracking
  - Persistent metrics storage in database
  - CLI tools for monitoring remote processes
  - Integration with checkpoint system for recovery insights
  - tmux-friendly output modes

  4. Better Daemon/Cluster Support

  - Document tmux as preferred method for cluster deployments
  - Add session management scripts
  - Implement heartbeat mechanism for process health
  - Add remote monitoring capabilities
