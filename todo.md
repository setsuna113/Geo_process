● You're absolutely right. Let's systematically understand what's happening with these dual orchestrators before proceeding.

     ☐ Analyze dual orchestrator architecture
     ☐ Run full pipeline test through export stage
     ☐ Debug any issues that arise
     ☐ Create unified orchestrator design plan
     ☐ Implement orchestrator unification

● Let me analyze the orchestrator situation systematically:

● Task(Analyze orchestrator architecture)
  ⎿  Done (13 tool uses · 47.1k tokens · 1m 46.5s)                                                                                                                                                    

● Based on this analysis, we have a clear picture:

  1. The base PipelineOrchestrator in orchestrator.py is the real, full-featured implementation
  2. EnhancedPipelineOrchestrator just adds structured logging on top
  3. The orchestrator/ subpackage appears to be dead code from an incomplete refactoring

  Let me verify which orchestrator the process_manager actually uses:

● Search(pattern: "from.*orchestrator.*import|EnhancedPipelineOrchestrator|PipelineOrchestrator", path: "scripts/process_manager.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 11 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● So process_manager.py uses EnhancedPipelineOrchestrator. Given that this is just a thin wrapper, I recommend we proceed with Option 1 - merge the enhanced features into the base orchestrator.

  Should I:
  1. First merge the structured logging into the base orchestrator
  2. Then update process_manager to use the base orchestrator
  3. Test it works
  4. Then clean up the redundant files

  Would you like me to proceed with this unification?

> maybe just keep as it, but rm the old orchestrator/

● You're right - that's a simpler approach. Let's just remove the unused orchestrator/ directory since it's dead code and causing confusion:

● Bash(rm -rf /home/yl998/dev/geo/src/pipelines/orchestrator/)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Good! Now let's verify the removal and run our pipeline test again:

● List(src/pipelines)
  ⎿  Listed 25 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Now let's update our todo list and run the pipeline:

● Great progress! The orchestrator conflict is resolved, but now we have a new recursion error in the database schema module. The error shows:

  File "/home/yl998/dev/geo/src/database/schema/__init__.py", line 123, in create_experiment
      return self._get_monolithic_schema().create_experiment(*args, **kwargs)

  This is calling itself recursively! Let me check the database schema init.py:

● Read(src/database/schema/__init__.py)
  ⎿  Read 176 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I see the issue! There's another naming conflict. The __init__.py imports:
  from .. import schema as monolithic_module

  This is trying to import the parent module's schema, but it's importing itself! Let me check what's in the parent directory:

● List(src/database)
  ⎿  Listed 28 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! So we have:
  - /src/database/schema.py - The original monolithic schema file
  - /src/database/schema/ - A directory with the same name

  The issue is that line 81 is trying to import schema.py but it's getting the schema/ module instead. Let me fix this:

● Update(src/database/schema/__init__.py)
  ⎿  Updated src/database/schema/__init__.py with 3 additions and 2 removals                
       78        def _get_monolithic_schema(self):
       79            """Get the working monolithic schema for delegation."""
       80            if not hasattr(self, '_monolithic_schema'):
       81 -              from .. import schema as monolithic_module
       82 -              self._monolithic_schema = monolithic_module.DatabaseSchema(self.db)
       81 +              # Import the schema.py file directly, not the schema/ module
       82 +              from ..schema import DatabaseSchema as MonolithicDatabaseSchema
       83 +              self._monolithic_schema = MonolithicDatabaseSchema(self.db)
       84            return self._monolithic_schema
       85            
       86        def create_schema(self) -> bool:

● Now let's run the pipeline again:

● Bash(export GEO_CONFIG_PATH=/home/yl998/dev/geo/config_test.yml && python -c "
      import sys…)
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> wait! Perfect! So we have:
    - /src/database/schema.py - The original monolithic schema file
    - /src/database/schema/ - A directory with the same name
  this is strange!

● Yes, exactly! This is another naming conflict just like the orchestrator situation. Having both:
  - /src/database/schema.py (a file)
  - /src/database/schema/ (a directory)

  ...is causing Python import confusion!

  When code tries to import from schema, Python gets confused about whether to import the file or the directory module. And even worse, the code in /src/database/schema/__init__.py is trying to
  import from the file but ends up importing itself, causing infinite recursion.

  Let me check what's being used where:

● Search(pattern: "from src\.database\.schema import|from \.\.schema import|from database\.schema import", glob: "**/*.py", output_mode: "content", head_limit: 20)
  ⎿  Found 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I see the pattern! Most code imports:
  - from src.database.schema import DatabaseSchema (expecting the CLASS)
  - from src.database.schema import schema (expecting the INSTANCE)

  They're expecting to import from the MODULE (the directory), not the file. So the directory is the "correct" one and the file is probably the old implementation.

  Let me check which one is newer:

● Bash(ls -la /home/yl998/dev/geo/src/database/schema* | head -20)
  ⎿  ls: cannot access 'glob': No such file or directory

● Bash(ls -la /home/yl998/dev/geo/src/database/ | grep schema)
  ⎿  -rw-rw-r--  1 yl998 yl998 13155 Jul 29 20:47 monitoring_schema.sql
     drwxrwxr-x  3 yl998 yl998  4096 Jul 30 16:34 schema
     -rw-rw-r--  1 yl998 yl998 70117 Jul 29 23:21 schema.py
     … +1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check if schema.py is still being imported anywhere:

● Search(pattern: "from.*database\.schema\s+import|from.*\.schema\s+import", glob: "**/*.py", output_mode: "content", head_limit: 10)
  ⎿  Found 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The orchestrator.py is importing from src.database.schema import schema expecting the directory module. Let's see if we should rename the old schema.py file:

● Read(src/database/schema.py)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> we need a clean and systemetic fix always. no renaming. err. we need to unify these two things
