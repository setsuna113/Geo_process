‚óè Summary

  I've successfully created a comprehensive test suite for the validation framework with:

  ‚úÖ 1. Unit Tests

  - Tests for all three validators (Bounds, Transform, Value)
  - Edge cases and error conditions
  - Validation of the validation framework itself

  ‚úÖ 2. Integration Tests

  - CoordinateMerger: Tests validation at data loading, spatial consistency checking, and merging
  - ResamplingProcessor: Tests source bounds, transformations, and output validation
  - Realistic scenarios with mocked dependencies

  ‚úÖ 3. Error Scenario Tests

  - Critical edge cases that could cause coordinate misalignment
  - Projection error accumulation
  - Boundary pixel shifts
  - Floating point precision issues
  - Composite validation failures

  ‚úÖ 4. Orchestrator Tests

  - Validation tracking across pipeline stages
  - Summary generation and reporting
  - Context integration
  - Error handling

  ‚úÖ 5. Performance Tests

  - Ensures validation doesn't create bottlenecks
  - Tests scalability with large datasets
  - Memory usage validation
  - Concurrency support

  üéØ Key Features Tested:

  1. Early Detection: Tests verify coordinate/bounds issues are caught at ingestion
  2. Detailed Diagnostics: Validation provides actionable error messages
  3. Pipeline Integration: Validation works seamlessly with existing processors
  4. Performance: Minimal overhead with linear scaling
  5. Robustness: Handles edge cases and errors gracefully

  The test suite ensures the validation framework will catch the coordinate integrity issues while maintaining good performance and providing clear diagnostics for debugging.

  To run the tests:
  # All validation tests
  python tests/run_validation_tests.py

  # Individual test modules  
  pytest tests/domain/validators/test_coordinate_integrity.py -v
  pytest tests/domain/validators/test_validation_performance.py -v -s

  The validation framework is now fully tested and ready to catch coordinate/bounds integrity issues in your biodiversity analysis pipeline!
